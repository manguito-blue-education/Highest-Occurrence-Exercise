# Highest Ocurrence

Write a function that receives an array with elements of **any kind** and return an array of the most repeated element in the array.
If more than one element has the same number of appearances, return all the elements (order not important). 
Try to avoid the use of `for`.

You should write the code inside the curly braces, where it says `Your amazing code here`.

## Examples

```javascript
highestOccurrence([2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2]) âžž [2]

highestOccurrence([1, 2, 3, 3, "a", "b", "b", "c"]) âžž [3, "b"]

highestOccurrence(["it", "keeps", "coding", "on", "or", "it", "gets", "the", "hose"]) âžž ["it"]

```

## Local Test

For testing your code you must run: 

```sh
npm install

npm run test

```

## Notes:

- You can read the test files, so you can have an idea of what is the expected result, but **do not edit them** please.

- **Extra points** if you don't use `for` in your solution.
